## info  
* 30 minutes prep
* 1 hour cook time

## ingredients
* simmering protein of your choice (it's traditional to use pork or chicken, but use what you have)
* potatoes, bite sized pieces
* carrots, bite sized pieces
* soy sauce
* vinegar (sugar cane recommended)
* water
* garlic, minced
* black pepper
* bay leaves

## steps  
1. In a large vessel for simmering, add enough oil to coat the bottom, medium high heat until shimmering.
2. Brown the protein. It should have moderate color but maintain some pink on the sides. Cook in batches as necessary to avoid crowding, make sure the fond does not burn. Set protein aside with carrots and potatoes 
3. Heat off, ensure there's adequate oil at the bottom to cook add the garlic, black pepper, and bay leaves to the pot. The vessel should be hot enough to make a gentle shh noise. This does not take long at all. 
4. Once your kitchen smells magnificent, add a cup of water (or your favorite deglazing liquid) and turn heat to medium. Make sure to scrape the pot and incorporate all that flavor into the sauce.
5. Add chicken, potatoes, and carrots to the pot. I suggest a 1:1.5 ratio of soy sauce to vinegar as a baseline. There should be enough soy sauce and vinegar to come halfway up the ingredients in the pot. 
6. Add water to cover and turn up the heat to high. Once it comes to a boil, turn the heat down and maintain a simmer. Cook until the potatoes and carrots are ideal for your taste (45 minutes for me).
