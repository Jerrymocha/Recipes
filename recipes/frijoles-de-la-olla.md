# Frijoles de la olla


## info  
* 1-2 hours cook time

## ingredients
* Beans (pinto, black beans, etc.)
* Onion (peeled and root trimmed off)
* Garlic (peeled)
* Spices (bay leaves, peppercorns, cardamom, etc.)

## steps  
1. Rinse beans, remove debris and pebbles, if any
2. Add beans, onion, garlic, spices, and a couple large pinches of salt to a large pot, cover with 2-4 inches of water
3. Heat on high, bring to a simmer, then lower heat to maintain simmer
4. Cook until beans are fork tender, about 1-2 hours depending on freshness of beans
5. Add salt to taste, serve

## notes  
* Pre soaking the beans is completely optional, it will reduce cook time but it leaches flavor into soaking liquid
* For refried beans, pour off cooking liquid, reserving a good portion on the side. Melt some fat into the beans and begin to mash the beans and stir in reserved liquid until desired consistency
